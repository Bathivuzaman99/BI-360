# BI-360
üîç Project Overview
Business Insights 360 is a multi-layered Power BI dashboard suite designed to unify performance metrics across Sales, Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive functions. Built with a modular architecture and dynamic filtering capabilities, it empowers stakeholders to explore KPIs, trends, and forecasts in real time‚Äîdriving faster, smarter decisions.
This project was developed as part of a data analytics bootcamp and refined through hands-on experience in cross-functional reporting. It integrates simulation logic, forecasting accuracy, and profitability analysis into a single, interactive interface.

üß© Business Use Case
Modern enterprises often struggle with fragmented reporting across departments. This dashboard solves that by:
- Centralizing performance data from multiple domains
- Benchmarking actuals vs targets across time periods and regions
- Visualizing product-level profitability to guide pricing and replenishment strategies
- Tracking forecast accuracy to improve supply chain planning
- Providing executive summaries for top-level decision-making
Each module‚ÄîSales View, Finance View, Marketing View, Supply Chain View, and Executive View‚Äîis designed to answer specific business questions while maintaining a consistent user experience.

üß† Technical Architecture

- DAX Measures: Custom calculations for Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Forecast Accuracy %, Profit %, YoY Growth, and Segment Ranking
- Visuals: Bubble charts, KPI cards, bar charts, donut charts, and matrix tables with drill-through capabilities
